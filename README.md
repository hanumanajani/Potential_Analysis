# 🧪 Potential Analysis Tool

The **Potential Analysis Tool** is a Python-based program designed to calculate **electrostatic potential distribution** across ion channels.  
It applies classical computational methods and has been used on **potassium channels** to study potential variation along the pore.  

## 🔬 Purpose
- Analyzes how **potential gradients** shape ion channel behavior.  
- Helps in understanding **ion conduction and gating mechanisms**.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Fully automated workflow for large-scale data.  
- Efficient classical calculation method.  
- Easy integration with molecular dynamics pipelines.
